# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# Create sample users

user1 = User.create(name: "John Doe")
user2 = User.create(name: "Jane Doe")

# Create sample foods

food1 = Food.create(name: "Chicken", measurement_unit: "kg", price: 1.5, quantity: 2, user_id: 1)

food3 = Food.create(name: "Chocolate", measurement_unit: "oz", price: 0.5, quantity: 4, user_id: 1)
food4 = Food.create(name: "Milk", measurement_unit: "lt", price: 1, quantity: 1, user_id: 1)
